BEFORE YOU START: 

Welcome! This is a Python-based program that I wrote on PyCharm.
Please run it in PyCharm, because I’m not sure whether it will work properly in other IDEs.

This is a program that automatically retrieves the data of videos and uploaders (also users)  from Bilibili.It is one of the largest long video platforms in China like YouTube.
I once considered extending the program to support videos from YouTube and TikTok, but I gave up because I couldn’t find valid APIs for them.
Therefore, for now, this program can only analyze URLs from Bilibili.

Although BiliBili is a Chinese website, it also has an English version. Or you can browse it using your browser’s machine translation feature, and there are plenty of English videos available on the platform as well.


HOW TO USE：

1. This program is very easy to use. It only needs a computer that can run PyCharm.
When you are ready, copy the code into PyCharm and run it.

2. The Requests library is essential for this program. Please make sure you have it installed. Otherwise, the program will not run.
If you are using PyCharm, installing the Requests library is very simple. If you do not know how to install it, just run the program once and when an error message appears, you can follow PyCharm’s prompt to install the library automatically.

3. Follow the instructions on the panel and enter the URLs. Don't forget to press the enter button after entering!
Use a comma (remember, no space after that comma) to separate multiple URLs. You can run as many tasks as you want at once.
The program will then display information.

4. Don’t worry about whether this program can analyze your URL, because the code can handle any URL that contains BVID (The BiliBili video identifier) or UID (User ID). If you enter a correct link, the link will always include one of them.


5. If it runs successfully, you will see the information appear on the panel.


That's all, hope you like it!
